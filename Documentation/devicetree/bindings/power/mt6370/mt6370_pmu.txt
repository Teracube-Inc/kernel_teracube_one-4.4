Mediatek MT6370 I2C Sub-pmic

Mediatek MT6370 is Integrated Sub Power Management Chips.
MT6370 integrates the functions included Charger, Backlight,
RGBLED, DisplayBias, Vib LDO, Flash LED.
Mediatek MT6370 is connected to an i2c bus.


Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "mediatek,mt6370_pmu";
- reg : Must be 0x34, it's MT6370 PMU default I2C Slave address.
- interrupt-controller : Since the MT6370 support several interrupts internally,
  it is considered as an interrupt controller cascaded to the SoC one.
- #interrupt-cells = <1>;
/* If CONFIG_MTK_GPIOLIB_STAND is defined, mt6370,intr_gpio_num is used. Otherwise we use mt6370,intr_gpio. */
- mt6370,intr_gpio_num : IRQ GPIO pin that's connected to MT6370 interrupt.
- mt6370,intr_gpio : general IRQ GPIO pin.

Optional node:
- core : core subdev for MT6370 core part.
- charger : charger subdev for MT6370 charger part.
- fled : flash led subdev for MT6370 flashLED part.
- ldo : ldo subdev for MT6370 Vib LDO part.
- rgbled : rgbled subdev for MT6370 RGB indicator part.
- bled : backlight subdev for MT6370 backlight led part.
- dsv : dsv subdev for MT6370 display bias part.


Example:
mt6370_pmu@34 {
	status = "ok";
	compatible = "mediatek,mt6370_pmu";
	reg = <0x34>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	mt6370,intr_gpio_num = <3>; /* direct defined GPIO num */
	mt6370,intr_gpio = <&pio 3 0>; /* genernal GPIO */
};
