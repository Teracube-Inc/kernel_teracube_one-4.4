Mediatek ispsys controller
============================

The Mediatek ispsys controller provides various clocks to the system.

Required Properties:

- compatible: Should be:
	- "mediatek,mt6739-ispsys", "syscon"
- #clock-cells: Must be 1

The ispsys controller uses the common clk binding from
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
The available clocks are defined in dt-bindings/clock/mt*-clk.h.

Example:
dip1@15022000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,dip1";
	reg = <0 0x15022000 0 0x6000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 322 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
};
