Richtek RT5081 I2C Sub-pmic

Richtek RT5081 is Integrated Sub Power Management Chips.
RT5081 integrates the functions included Charger, Backlight,
RGBLED, DisplayBias, Vib LDO, Flash LED.
Richtek RT5081 is connected to an i2c bus.


Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "richtek,rt5081_pmu";
- reg : Must be 0x34, it's RT5081 PMU default I2C Slave address.
- interrupt-controller : Since the RT5081 support several interrupts internally,
  it is considered as an interrupt controller cascaded to the SoC one.
- #interrupt-cells = <1>;
/* If CONFIG_MTK_GPIOLIB_STAND is defined, rt,intr_gpio_num is used. Otherwise we use rt,intr_gpio. */
- rt,intr_gpio_num : IRQ GPIO pin that's connected to RT5081 interrupt.
- rt,intr_gpio : general IRQ GPIO pin.

Optional node:
- core : core subdev for RT5081 core part.
- charger : charger subdev for RT5081 charger part.
- fled : flash led subdev for RT5081 flashLED part.
- ldo : ldo subdev for RT5081 Vib LDO part.
- rgbled : rgbled subdev for RT5081 RGB indicator part.
- bled : backlight subdev for RT5081 backlight led part.
- dsv : dsv subdev for RT5081 display bias part.


Example:
rt5081_pmu@34 {
	status = "ok";
	compatible = "richtek,rt5081_pmu";
	reg = <0x34>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	rt,intr_gpio_num = <3>; /* direct defined GPIO num */
	rt,intr_gpio = <&pio 3 0>; /* genernal GPIO */
};
